			<h1>Subject description</h1>
			<p>"Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" aims to provide a global vision of Computer Engineering in both academic and professional points of view. The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals on which
				this engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics), the future professional careers and the
				role of a computer engineer in today's society.
				The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, while the second helps
				develop practical skills</p>
			<p>The first part covers three fundamental blocks of content.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical perspective: past, present and future of Computer
					Engineering. Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor: anthropological
					and ethical foundations.</li>
				<li>Information and Data: Information representation. Organization of information.</li>
				<li>Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends in
					computer systems and applications.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical skills where an introduction to web
				development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page on contents related
				to the course.
				Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills, this course contributes to the development
				basic soft-skills for an engineer, such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills, both oral and
				written, of technical information, favouring the comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in the educational
				project of the University.</p>

			<h1>Goal</h1>
			<p>The specific objectives that this subject aims to achieve are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To understand the purpose of Computer Engineering, its ultimate goal, and the societal benefits it provides, while reflecting on the role each individual wishes to play as an engineer in the future society</li>
				<li>To gain knowledge about the pillars on which technological progress must be based, including a historical perspective on technological development.</li>
				<li>To recognize the importance of the human factor in professional practice and foster a sense of service and contribution to the common good.</li>
				<li>To have a global vision of the field of study, its various areas of knowledge, and to distinguish career paths and professional profiles in order to question one's own vocation</li>
				<li>To provide knowledge about current paradigms, trends in computing, data management, and an introduction to web development.</li>
			</ul>
