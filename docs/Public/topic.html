				<h1>What are LLMs?</h1>
				<p>Large Language models are a type of language model able to achieve both general-purpose language understanding and generation. During training, LLMs use vast quantities of data to learn billions of parameters, and they need a lot of processing power to do this. This is how they get their skills. Artificial neural networks, primarily transformers, known as LLMs are (pre-)trained through the use of semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques.</p>

				<h1>Transformers</h1>
				<p>Transformers are neural networks that operate based on selecting data and examining its relationships with other data, words, or sentences, so they can improve the understanding and production of text in  LLM. Transformers uses many operations such as word embeddings and attention levels. It all started with the publication of an article edited by Vaswani titled "Attention is all you need". A new structure of LLM and transformers is established to explain how  attention works. We used RNN and CNN self-attention mechanisms, which would otherwise reduce training time. The use of self-attention mechanisms has resulted in several advantages. Some important features of transformers are that they can manipulate remote information and do not use iterative connections like RNNs. That is, it is efficient when working with large amounts of data. To obtain the result, the transformer assigns the input vector to an output vector of similar length. Within Transformers, there are several blocks that contain networks with several technologies, and the self-attention layer is one of the most important. This is because you can leverage information from large amounts of data without using regular connections.</p>

				<h1>Some real life examples</h1>
				<p>The artificial intelligence known as ChatGPT is a sophisticated language model developed by OpenAI. It possesses a vast knowledge base up to January 2022 and is designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. ChatGPT is adept at understanding and generating content across a wide range of topics, making it a versatile tool for various applications.</p>
				<p>Although certainly one of the most popular models, GPT isn't the only one, why not investigate more about these models like Google Bard? Check the links below to further explore the topic.</p>
